## Purpose: This class generates synthetic conversational data using the Llama 3.1 model.

### Overview:
The Llama family of models can generate text by following specific templates. In this case, we use a template to simulate a conversation between a user and an assistant. The process involves two main steps:

1. **User Prompt Generation**: Given a starting prompt for the user, the model generates a random user prompt.
2. **Assistant Response Generation**: This user prompt is then used as input to generate the assistant's response, creating a complete conversational exchange.

By running this process in a loop, we can create a dataset of synthetic conversations. The quality and coherence of the generated dataset depend on the underlying model's performance and training data.

### Key Features:
- The script uses the Llama 3.1 model to generate synthetic data.
- It includes functions to load the model, generate text, and sample tokens using top-p sampling.
- The generated dataset is saved in a JSONL file format, with each line containing a user-assistant conversation pair.

### Usage:
1. Initialize the `SyntheticDataGenerator` with the directory containing the model checkpoints.
2. Use the `synthesize_data` method to generate the desired number of conversation pairs and save them to a file.
